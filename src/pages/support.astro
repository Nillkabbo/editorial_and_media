        <h2>Your Support Makes a Difference</h2>
        <p>
          Independent publishing requires resources. Unlike commercial publishers
          or institutions with large endowments, we rely on community support to
          sustain our operations. Your contribution helps us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Maintain editorial independence:</strong> Free from commercial
            and institutional pressures, we can publish work based solely on quality
            and contribution. Your support ensures we don't need to compromise our
            editorial standards for revenue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support emerging scholars:</strong> Through mentorship programs,
            writing workshops, and editorial guidance, we help graduate students and
            early-career researchers develop their voices and share their work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep content accessible:</strong> We don't charge readers to access
            our content or authors to publish with us. Your support makes this
            open-access model sustainable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sustain rigorous review:</strong> Quality peer review and editorial
            support require time and expertise. Your contributions help us maintain
            these standards without passing costs to authors or readers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expand our reach:</strong> From SEO optimization to newsletter
            distribution to platform improvements, your support helps us reach more
            readers and have greater impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every contribution, regardless of size, helps us advance our mission. Whether
          you're a researcher who values open access, a reader who benefits from our
          content, or someone who believes in the importance of accessible scholarship,
          your support makes a real difference.
