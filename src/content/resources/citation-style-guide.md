## Introduction

Proper citation is essential for academic integrity and scholarly communication. This guide provides quick reference for the three most common citation styles: APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), and Chicago Manual of Style.

## APA Style (7th Edition)

APA style is commonly used in social sciences, education, and psychology. It emphasizes author-date citations and recency of sources.

**Three or more authors:**

## Chicago Manual of Style (17th Edition)

Chicago style offers two systems: Notes-Bibliography (NB) and Author-Date. The NB system uses footnotes or endnotes.

### Notes-Bibliography System

- Smith argues that citation practices matter.¹

**Footnote:**
1. John Smith, *Research Methods in Education* (New York: Academic Press, 2023), 45.

**Bibliography entry:**

### Author-Date System

- (Smith 2023, 45)

**Reference list entry:**
Smith, John. 2023. *Research Methods in Education*. New York: Academic Press.

## Common Citation Challenges

### Online Sources

**APA:** Include DOI when available. If no DOI, use URL.
**MLA:** Include access date for websites without publication dates.
**Chicago:** Include access date in notes for online sources.

### Missing Information

- **No author:** Use title in place of author name
- **No date:** Use "n.d." (APA, Chicago) or omit date (MLA)
- **No page numbers:** Use paragraph numbers (para. 5) or section headings

### Multiple Works by Same Author

**APA:** Include author name each time, order by year
**MLA:** Include shortened title if multiple works by same author
**Chicago:** Include shortened title in notes

## Best Practices

1. **Be consistent:** Use one citation style throughout your document
2. **Cite as you write:** Don't add citations later—cite sources as you use them
3. **Verify details:** Check all citation information for accuracy
4. **Use citation tools wisely:** Software can help, but always verify output
5. **When in doubt:** Consult the official style guide or ask your instructor/editor

## Quick Decision Guide

- **Social sciences, education, psychology:** Use APA
- **Literature, languages, humanities:** Use MLA
- **History, some social sciences:** Use Chicago
- **Check with your instructor or publisher:** They may have specific requirements
